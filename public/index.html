                <p>
                    A dedicated and driven Cloud Engineer with a solid foundation in AWS, Linux, scripting, 
                    and Infrastructure as Code. Over the past 6 months, I have developed and deployed 
                    complex, highly available architectures on AWS, utilizing Terraform for IaC and 
                    implementing CI/CD pipelines for efficient application delivery. Known for my 
                    resourcefulness and enthusiasm for learning, I deliver scalable, secure, and cost-effective 
                    cloud solutions that align with business goals.
