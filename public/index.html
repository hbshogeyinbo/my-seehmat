                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>
                    A dedicated and driven Cloud Engineer with a solid foundation in AWS, Linux, scripting, 
                    and Infrastructure as Code. Over the past 6 months, I have developed and deployed 
                    complex, highly available architectures on AWS, utilizing Terraform for IaC and 
                    implementing CI/CD pipelines for efficient application delivery. Known for my 
                    resourcefulness and enthusiasm for learning, I deliver scalable, secure, and cost-effective 
                    cloud solutions that align with business goals.

                <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
                <p>Over the past 6 months, I have been developing projects on AWS. I can confidently navigate the Linux command line and can write scripts and automation in both Bash and Python. I have created complex CICD pipelines and can comfortably create infrastructure using Terraform. I am eager to learn new things and to apply that knowledge to my work.</p>
